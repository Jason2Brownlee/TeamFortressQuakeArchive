Introduction
------------

TeamFortress is a new QuakeC patch which radically changes
team games. It provides far more incentive for teams to 
actually work as a team. Each member of the team has unique
weapons, items, and abilities.

Although the patch works just fine in normal Quake maps, it
is designed to be run in maps written specifically for it.
There are a number of these maps available, and new ones 
appearing weekly.

What do you need to know?
-----------------------
Well, you should read this file, and you should read the help
inside the game. No, I don't mean the default Quake help!
If you play TeamFortress, you'll notice that instead of seeing
"Help" in the main menu, you'll see "TF Help".
Read the help there, and play!
		
Player Classes
--------------
TeamFortress uses multiple player classes.
All players start in Observer mode. 
When in Observer Mode, players can use their fire button to cycle
through all the observation points on a map, and watch the action.
To get out of Observer Mode, players must choose a class.

You can choose a class in two ways:
Either select the class from the menu which appears, or type in
the class's short name. Read the TF Help in Quake to find out the
short names for each class.

The classes are as follows:
	SCOUT:		Fastest moving class. Can only wear a small amount of the 
				lowest absorption armor. Limited to the 2 Shotguns and Nailgun.
				Low ammo levels.
				Carries a Motion Detector, 3 flares, 2 concussion grenades.

	SNIPER:		Medium speed. Wears only small amount of armor, upto medium
				absorption level. Limited to Nailgun and Sniper's rifle. Medium
				ammo levels.
				Carries 2 hand grenades.

	SOLDIER:	Slow moving class. Wears large amount of armor, at all 
				absorption levels. All normal weapons except Grenade Launcher.
				High ammo levels.
				Carries 4 hand grenades, 4 nail grenades.

	DEMOLITION MAN: Medium speed. Wears medium amount of armor, upto medium
				absorption level. Uses the ShotGun and Grenade/Pipebomb Launcher
				Carries 1 DetPack, 6 hand grenades, 4 Mirv Grenades.

	COMBAT MEDIC: Medium speed. Wears medium amount of armor, upto medium
				absorption level. Uses both Shotguns and the Super Nailgun.
				Carries Medikit, 3 hand grenades, 1 concussion grenades.
				Regenerates slowly. Has a Bioweapon.

	HEAVY WEAPONS GUY: The slowest moving class of all. Lotsa armor, high
				absorption levels. Uses both Shotguns, the Nailgun, and
				the Assault Cannon (yeah!)
				Carries 4 hand grenades and 1 Mirv Grenade.

	PYRO:		Medium speed. Wears some flame-resistant armor.  Uses the 
				shotgun, flamethrower, and incendiary cannon. 
				Carriers 1 hand grenade and 4 Napalm grenades.

	RANDOM PC : Each time you respawn you have your class randomly 
				assigned to you.

New Weapons
-----------
Please note that the New Weapons do not show up on the row of weapon
icons in the status bar. There is a reason for this. At first, we used
to light up the weapon icon corresponding to the number of the New Weapon.
For example, the Heavy Weapons Guy has the Assault Cannon, and can select
it by pressing 7. So we lit up the Rocket Launcher icon. We immediately
got lots of mail from people saying "I can't get the rocket launcher
readied when I'm the Heavy Weapons Guy!".
So we don't light them up.

Sniper Rifle:
	This weapon is used instead of the shotgun by the SNIPER playerclass. It
	uses shotgun shells for ammo, and operates in two modes:
		- Single Shot. With a reload time of 2.5 seconds, this mode is what
		  sniping is all about. One shot from this will kill most players
		  except for a heavily armored SOLDIER or DEMOLITION MAN.
		  The longer you aim, the more damage the sniper shot will do.
		  To aim, just keep holding down the fire button. 
		  When aiming, the view slowly zooms in. You can disable this
		  feature using the "autozoom" command.
		- Auto Shot. Although this fire mode does a lot less damage than
		  single shot and uses a lot of ammo, its great for picking off
		  a wounded target, or a fast moving SCOUT.
	The other tricky bit about the sniper rifle is that it is a rifle. You
	can't just snap shot from the hip with it. If you're moving too fast,
	the rifle simply won't fire. Besides, you're a sniper, you're not
	supposed to be strafe-fighting with soldiers! :)
	Select it as if it was the shotgun.

Assault Cannon:
	Big! Fires lotsa bullets! Really fast!
	What more do you want?
	It's used by the Heavy Weapons Guy. Select it like you would the
	Rocket Launcher. It takes 10 cells just to power up	each time you 
	pull the trigger, and then starts to eat up your shotgun ammo like 
	you wouldn't believe!
	It also tends to eat up enemies too, so it isn't all bad :)
	As you fire the Assault Cannon, it gets hotter and harder to control. 
	After firing, it has to cool. This can take a while, and is dependant 
	on how long you fired it for, natch :)
	Luckily, cooling require no effort on your part, so you can change
	weapons while you wait.
	Oh, you can't move while firing either, and you can't fire when
	you're not on the ground.
	Select it as if it was the rocket launcher.

BioWeapon:
	This weapon is used by the COMBAT MEDIC. The COMBAT MEDIC's axe has two
	modes: Medikit and BioWeapon. In Bioweapon Mode, when the COMBAT MEDIC
	hits someone with the axe, they will become infected, and begin to lose
	health. Anyone coming in contact with an infected person also becomes
	infected. Infection can be cured by the COMBAT MEDIC's medikit.
	COMBAT MEDICS are immune to the Bioweapon.

Incendiary Cannon:
	This weapon is used in place of the rocket launcher by the PYRO class.
	It does a little damage, and sets everyone in radius on fire. 
	Select it as if it was the rocket launcher.

Grenades
--------
Several new types of grenades now exist, and all classes have access to at
least one of them. They are not to be confused with the grenades used by
the grenade launcher.
Use of these grenades is exactly as one would expect. Pull the pin, throw
it, and wait. After 3 seconds it goes off. Just make sure you throw it
_before_ the 3 seconds are up :)

I strongly suggest you use the aliases we provide in the fortress.cfg 
to throw grenades. Bind it to a key. Then, when you press the key, the
grenade will be primed, and when you release the key, the grenade will
be thrown.
Don't forget, the grenade goes off after 3 seconds :)

The grenade types are as follows:
	Hand		:	Hand grenades simply explode. They are twice as powerful
					as those shot from the grenade launcher.

	Concussion	:	Concussion grenades don't actually hurt anyone, they just
					blow everyone away from the grenade explosion at a high
					speed, and then make them woozy. They're the SCOUT's best 
					way of escaping from a roomful of enemies. The ensuing confusion 
					usually gives him enough time to run.

	Nail		:	Nail grenades are good in large rooms. Instead of detonating,
					they raise up into the air and hover. They then begin to 
					rotate while firing nails. After doing this for a few seconds
					they explode like a normal grenade.

	Mirv		:	Mirv grenades are room-clearers. When one explodes,
					it divides into approximately 15 individual grenades which
					then explode.

	Napalm		:	When these explode they throw flames out in all directions,
					setting things, like players, alight.

	Flare		:	These aren't really grenades. When they go off, they 
					simply light up the area around them. They go out after 
					a while.

New Items
---------
Motion Detector:
	This item is the SCOUT's best friend. The SCOUT can specify an amount of
	cells spent on a scan. The detector displays a list of all enemies/friends
	within a distance around the SCOUT, and their direction in relation to the 
	SCOUT. The more energy spent, the larger the detection distance.
	Bear in mind though that the motion detector only detects motion (natch! :)
	So it won't pick up stationary or very slow moving players.
	You can toggle detection of friends and enemies using the aliases "scane" 
	and "scanf".

Medikit:
	The COMBAT MEDIC has a medikit which allows him to heal any other member
	of his/her team by hitting them with his axe, when it is in Medikit Mode. 
	Each hit will heal them	10 points and reduce the 'ammo' for the medikit 
	by 10. You can see how much 'ammo' for the medikit you have by looking 
	at your inventory. If the COMBAT MEDIC walks over a health box while at 
	maximum health, the health box will be used to replenish the medikit 'ammo'.

Detpack:
	The DEMOLITION MAN has a Detpack. This is a large-scale explosive device.
	When the DEMOLITION MAN places it he is unable to move for 4 seconds
	while he primes it.
	The timer on the Detpack is set by the DEMOLITION MAN, using the 
	"det5", "det10", and "det20" aliases. For more info on the Detpack
	aliases, read the TF Help in Quake.
	Scouts can disarm Detpacks by running over them. It does take a couple
	of seconds tho.

New Rules
---------
Reloading:
	All basic weapons except the Nailgun and Super Nailgun have clips. When all
	the ammo in a clip is spent, the weapon is reloaded. This can take anywhere
	from 1 second for the Shotgun to 5 seconds for the Rocket Launcher. Ammo
	amounts in the clips varies between weapons.
	While reloading, you cannot change weapons.
	You can force a reload at any time with the "reload" alias, in 
	preparation for a fight :)

Armor Classes:
	There are various classes of armor now, which protect against various
	different attack types. Each playerclass is restricted to using only
	certain types. 
	You can find out what class of armor you're wearing using the Inventory
	command. When you pick up armor, the message displayed will tell you
	what armor class it is, if any.

ToggleAble Game Settings
------------------------
There are now a few toggleable game settings which can be changed while
playing. Each has an alias which toggles it.
The options at the moment are:
	Multiskin/Classkin
		This option switches between Multiskin, where each player can use the 
		skin commands to cycle through all the available skins and choose one
		they like, and Classkin, where each player has his/her skin chosen
		for them based on their class.
	Class Persistence On/Off
		This option allows you to turn on Class persistence between levels.
		E.g. If it's on, when you go to a new level each player will stay
		the same class they were in the last level.
	Cheat Checking On/Off
		This option toggles whether you want speed checking of players in
		an attempt to catch people tinkering with their maxspeed. It's not
		an elegant way of checking, and is by no mean foolproof, so you
		may wish to turn it off. If you're playing with friends, turn it off
		and save some of the server's computing time. If you're playing on 
		the net, you might want to leave it on. It's better than nothing :)
	FortressMap On/Off
		This option turns on the use of effects which only work on maps
		built specifically for TeamFortress. I'd advise against turning 
		it on in maps that aren't built for TeamFortress. 
		If you play on a TeamFortress Map, TeamFortress will detect this,
		and set this setting On, but you're welcome to turn it off if
		you want to deathmatch. 
		See TeamFortressMap Details below for more info.
	AutoTeam On/Off
		When on, AutoTeam will automatically assign players to the team
		with the least number of people in it, when the player chooses
		his/her class.
	Respawn Delay Cycle
		You can cycle through various respawn delay times. Respawn
		delay time is the amount of time a player is unable to respawn
		for after they die.
		This is useful in Team Games to prevent players from killing
		themselves to get back to their Fortress quickly.
	TeamFrags On/Off
		When On, this toggleflag makes each player's frag count equal
		to the number of points his/her team has. Using TAB key you can
		then see how each team is going.
	Manual-COlor On/Off
		When Off, which is default, Team colors are automatically assigned.
		When On, Team colors are assigned based upon the player who creates
		them. See below.
	Server Toggle
		This toggleflag has one use: When it's set, no toggleflags can
		ever been changed again. This can be used by a server operator
		to set the state of the toggleflags and then lock them in place.

Multiple Compile Modes
-----------------------
Using the preprocessor that John wrote, we can use the same source code
to produce quite different patches. At the moment, we've got 3 versions,
which are as follows:

	Standard:
		- The patch you've all grown to know and love.

	Co-Op:
		- Is the only version with Quake monsters in it.
		- If you set the coop variable to 2, then any doors which 
		  require keys won't open until all players have unlocked them.
		- Has more advanced skill settings. 
			- Skill 0,1,2 are all the same as normal quake.
			- Skill 2.1 is Nightmare mode.
			- Skills between 2.2 and 3 make monsters respawn. The number
			  of times monsters respawn is as follows:
			  	number of respawns = (skill - 2.1) * 10
			  e.g. Skill 2.5 makes monsters respawn 4 times.

	Net:
		- Basically designed to reduce net traffic.
		- Sniper rifle made a little tougher, and autozoom defaults to off.
		  (Ever tried to snipe someone when you've got a ping of 350?)

Team Details
-----------------------
We now handle a basic Team structure. Apart from standard Teamplay,
you can use FortressTeams. In FortressTeams we allow upto 4 different
teams on the one map.
Players can join a team by using the aliases imin1,imin2,imin3, and imin4.
The first player to join a particular team becomes the Team Leader.
If the Manual-Color Toggleflag is on (see above), the color of of the 
Team Leader's pants becomes the Team Color. Otherwise, the Team Colors
are automatically assigned.
Any players who join the Team from then on will have their colors 
automatically changed to the Team Colors.

Once players join a team they cannot change to another team.
Player's cannot change their _pants_ color, although Shirt colors can 
be changed freely.
FortressTeams are a must on any Map that was written for TeamFortress,
since the spawnpoints on a TeamFortress Map are allocated to particular
teams. See the TeamFortressMap Details for more info.
Now, when you join a team, you are also shown the classes that your
team members are playing as. You can also use the command "showclasses"
to see what class they are at any particular time. Very useful if your
team members are playing RandomPC.

TeamFortressMap Details
-----------------------
As of v1.2 we've got support built in for maps designed specifically
for this patch, allowing them to use various extra entities.
This allows us to do fancy things, such as:

	Auto Detection
	Team SpawnPoints
	Armor 			

	Goals
	GoalItems
	Timer Goals

These only come into effect if the Toggleable game setting FortressMap is On,
and the map you are playing on is designed for TeamFortress.
If you want to create your own Maps for TeamFortress, the details you
need to know are in a separate file, included in this .zip, called tfortmap.txt

Servers with this Code
----------------------
If you're interested in using some/all of this code for a Net server, 
then all I ask is one thing: Mail me (address below) and tell me. 
I'd like to know if anyone uses it as a Net server, simply because I'd like 
to play a server on the net using this code. 
Since I don't have a server...;)
The biggest advantage of notifying me that you're running a server
with this code is that I'll mail you new versions whenever they come out.

Make sure you use the Net version on a server, since it's much
nicer on bandwidth.

Copyright and Distribution
--------------------------------------
Authors may use this code for the basis of other freeware quakec
code, but not for any for-profit code, such as modification of this 
patch for the purpose of running it on a commercial Quake Server.

You may distribute this patch in any electronic format as long as this 
textfile remains unmodified and all of the files in the archive are
present, and as long as no charge is made for it.

Non-Commercial Quake Servers are free to run this patch, but 
it'd be nice in you mailed us and mentioned that you are.

Availability
------------
The latest version of this patch can always be found at the 
TeamFortress WWW page:

Other Stuff
-----------
TeamFortress was written by Robin Walker, John Cook, and Ian Caughley. 
Various other people contributed ideas to the original version: 
I can't hope to list them all, but here's some of them:
	Peter Wilson, Jason Grant.

A special mention _must_ go to Alexandre Brouaux (brouauxa@micronet.fr),
who's been a fantastic help, not only with the actual coding, but also
with other problems. The Pyro class is a direct result of his help.

Some of the code for TeamFortress was influenced by other people's.
They are as follows:
	Both Flame Grenades and the Flamer were almost entirely written
	by Alexandre Brouaux (brouauxa@micronet.fr). Thanks Alexandre!
	Mirv Grenade code was influenced by Firewall code from Steve Bond (wedge@nuc.net)
	Pipebomb code was influenced by code from AsmodeusB (tazq@sos.on.ca)

Although we've never seen their code, these people are credited here
because they've got great ideas:
	Multiskin, from the first person to work it out, Dennis Noordsij (lnoordsi@inter.NL.net)

Also, thanks must go to the following people for their comments and suggestions:
	John Wolsch (john_w@bga.com)
	Thomas LULLIER (106110.1406@compuserve.com)
	Alexandre Brouaux (brouauxa@micronet.fr)
	Bas Olthoff (reboot@dsl.nl)
	Phil Sykes (phil@centrenet.co.uk)
	Serendip (an705819@anon.penet.fi)
	Frank O'Connor (FrankO@mail.Publix.com)
	Chi Tang (ctang@nucleus.com)
	Chris Etheridge (etherbi@castlegate.net)
	Kevin Cheng (chengn@stu.ca)
	Matt Cortes (link@alpha.pulsar.net)
	Mark Rosten (mark@barney.dungeon.com)
	Craig Daily (cadaily@usa.pipeline.com)
We wouldn't have got past 1.0, let alone the rest, if it wasn't 
for these guys/gals.

Also, major thanks goes to Tom (rist@pacbell.net) for writing the 
TeamFortress Semi-Technical FAQ, which can be got from the WWW page.

And finally, thanks must go to Mike Kaminski (LKKAM@msn.com), for pointing
out the stupidest mistake I've made for a while :)

What are we working on now?
Version 1.4 is going to have two new classes :
	Spy, Engineer
Also, we'll have simple 'bot code for people who don't have enough
players in their neighbourhood to have enough players on each team:
	SniperBot, SoldierBot, MedicBot, HeavyWeaponsBot, and Turrets.

I'm happy to help with any questions about the source you have.
One thing that we took pains to do was to make almost _everything_ #defined. 
You can 'tweak' 90% the game details just by editing the defs.qc

Finally, if you want to talk to me, or play me, I can usually be found
most nights of the week on quake1.mel.aone.net.au, or quake.netspace.net.au
I'll be happy to answer any questions, or talk over suggestions.

--------------------------------
Version 1.32 - Released 10/11/96
--------------------------------
Features added:
	- Nextlevel command.
		Players can use the "Nextlevel" command to cycle through the
		v1.3 FortressMaps and choose which one will be played when the
		current one ends.
	- Deathmatch 3 setting.
		When in deathmatch 3, players can choose the class they will
		respawn as.

Changes:
	- Removed all pre-impulses.
	  	We used these in LAN games and they're fine. But on the net,
	  	the lag can cause problems with them. So they're gone. We 
	  	have left in the pre-impulses for Detpacks and Scanners so
	  	players can still define their own time settings/energy levels.
	- Detpack setting changed.
	  	Instead of stopping you for 4 seconds when you set a detpack,
	  	now you have to hold down the Detpack-Set key for 4 seconds
	  	without moving, and you can stop and run at any time.
	 	The old method is still there if you want to use it instead.
	- Sniper Rifle changed.
		It takes a little longer to build up the damage now, so snap-shots
		won't kill so much. Aiming still builds up the damage.
		Also, the Sniper must stop moving before he can start to aim.
	- Team Color Checking
		Now it doesn't penalise the player in any way for changing colors,
		it just sets them back. Players with lag on servers would get 
		penalised before they're colors had been set when they joined a 
		team. :)
