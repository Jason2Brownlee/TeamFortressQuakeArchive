## v1.22

The filename for this release is not known. It was probably released as `tf_v122.zip`.

The changelog from v1.3 does not include mention of v1.22, it jumps from v1.21 to v1.2

There is mention that the TeamFortress homepage was updated on Blues News on September 21st:

> Go check out the Team Fortress Page which has been completely redone to make it easier to learn about their new concept for teamplay

This suggests that `bluesnews.com` was aware of TeamFortress, but no mention of the mod appears prior to this date (as far as I can tell).

A copy of the release was found unzipped on the "[Phenomenon](https://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/34043)" Addon Quake CD.

## v1.3

This version was released as `tf1_3.zip`.

The release as mentioned on the TeamFortress homepage:

> 31/10/96\
> Released v1.3 last night. It seems to be virtually bug-free, thanks to our beta-testers. Though i am still worried about the problem where the game would sometimes crash when a grenade was thrown. I think it is fixed, but if happens to anyone, please mail me.
TF v1.4 is already started! It will feature two new classes, the Spy and the Assassin. It will also include gun turrets, auto-turrets, and team bots.

## v1.31

The filename for this release is not known.

This version is mentioned on the TeamFortress news page:

> 4/11/96\
> Released v1.31 today. Fixed some known bugs, and some previously unknown bugs too. Added some other features.
>
> 3/11/96\
> I plan on releasing v1.31 tomorrow with some bug fixes and some changes to the Pyro; we played a lot today, and decided that he was too tough.
>
> 1/11/96\
> I've been working on a pre-processor for the quakeC compiler today, but it looks like there will be a TF v1.31 coming out soon. The bugs that have been found are:\
> - the server crashing because of a grenade being thrown (doesn't happen often)
> - pipebomb problems.\
> These problems will be fixed soon. Just go easy on the grenades and pipebombs :)

-- [http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~cookj/pages/working.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/19970121054840/http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~cookj/pages/working.htm) (archived)

This suggests that v1.31 was released on November 4th 1996.

This matches the date in the changelog from the v1.35 release:

```text
--------------------------------
Version 1.31 - Released 4/11/96
--------------------------------
Features added:
	- Class choices are announced to Team Members.

Changes:
	- Pyro Class made a little weaker, as follows:

		"I just commented out the debug!" John cried :)
	- Grenade names in inventory fixed.
	- Updating of Current Ammo fixed.
	- Weapon firing in air fixed.
		"Who the hell is DeMorgan?!?!" Robin screams :)
	- Speed resetting when a GoalItem is removed corrected.
	- Detpack activation of Goals fixed.
```

## v1.32

The filename for this release is not known.

This version is mentioned on the TeamFortress news page:

> 10/11/96\
> v1.32 has been released, and we have started work on v1.4. The Spy and Scuba Commando have been designed, the assassin scraped and'merged' with the spy. So far, the spy will be able to:
Disguise: can change skin and team colors. Takes 5 seconds to change.
Backstab: Has a knife which does 30 damage normally, or 120 damage if he strikes from behind (backstab!).
Caltrops: Little spiky things that get stuck in peoples feet, doing small amounts of damage and slowing them down.
And some other suprises...
>
> 9/11/96\
> The preprocessor is finished, so our code will look a little different from now on. We are planning on releasing v1.32 in a few days, with some small changes (mainly for net play).

-- [http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~cookj/pages/working.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/19970121054840/http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~cookj/pages/working.htm) (archived)

This suggests that v1.32 was released on November 10th 1996.

This matches the date in the changelog from the v1.35 release:

```text
--------------------------------
Version 1.32 - Released 10/11/96
--------------------------------
Features added:
	- Nextlevel command.
		Players can use the "Nextlevel" command to cycle through the
		v1.3 FortressMaps and choose which one will be played when the
		current one ends.
	- Deathmatch 3 setting.
		When in deathmatch 3, players can choose the class they will
		respawn as.

Changes:
	- Removed all pre-impulses.
	  	We used these in LAN games and they're fine. But on the net,
	  	the lag can cause problems with them. So they're gone. We
	  	have left in the pre-impulses for Detpacks and Scanners so
	  	players can still define their own time settings/energy levels.
	- Detpack setting changed.
	  	Instead of stopping you for 4 seconds when you set a detpack,
	  	now you have to hold down the Detpack-Set key for 4 seconds
	  	without moving, and you can stop and run at any time.
	 	The old method is still there if you want to use it instead.
	- Sniper Rifle changed.
		It takes a little longer to build up the damage now, so snap-shots
		won't kill so much. Aiming still builds up the damage.
		Also, the Sniper must stop moving before he can start to aim.
	- Team Color Checking
		Now it doesn't penalise the player in any way for changing colors,
		it just sets them back. Players with lag on servers would get
		penalised before they're colors had been set when they joined a
		team. :)

Bugs Removed:
	- Announcing of class choices when deathmatching.
	- Sniper aiming not incrementing damage.
	- Teamfrags not keeping correct count.
	- Team 4 wasn't working.
```

## v1.33

This version was released as `tf1_33.zip` and/or `v1_33pak.zip`.

This version is mentioned on the TeamFortress news page:

> 12/11/96\
> We've made the detpack exposion more impressive (and dangerous). We've fixed a small bug in v1.32, i will put v1.33 up soon.

-- [http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~cookj/pages/working.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/19970121054840/http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~cookj/pages/working.htm) (archived)

This suggests that v1.33 was released around November 12th 1996.

This is close to the release date mentioned in the changelog from the v1.35 release:

```text
--------------------------------
Version 1.33 - Released 11/11/96
--------------------------------
Bugs Removed:
	- Nextlevel command not working.
```

-- README.TXT

## v1.34

There's no mention of this release on the TeamFortress news page.

This version is not mentioned in the online version of the release history:

* [http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~cookj/pages/version.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/19970121054854/http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~cookj/pages/version.htm) (archived)

The changelog from v1.35 suggests there was no v1.34:

```text
Changes TeamFortress v1.35 from v1.33
======================================
```

-- v1_35pak.zip/CHANGES.TXT

The readme for the 1.35 release suggests that v1.34 was an internal release:

```text
--------------------------------
Version 1.34 - Internal Version
--------------------------------
Features added:
	- Monster's put back in.
	- Co-Op version implemented.
```

-- v1_35pak.zip/README.TXT

* `v1_35pak.zip`
* `net1_35.zip`
* `coop1_35.zip`
* `v1_35src.zip`
* `1_35nopr.zip`

This version is mentioned on the TeamFortress news page:

> 30/11/96\
> I've put v1.35 on the web page now, along with the Net and Coop versions. Only the server needs the special version. The Coop version is kindof a beta, so any comments or suggestions about it are very welcome.
>
> 27/11/96\
> Sorry about the delay, but v1.35 won't be released until tomorrow. This is because i've decided to add in a menu system for choosing teams/classes.
>
> 26/11/96\
> I'm planning on releasing TF v1.35, TF coop beta, and a net server version of TF later today. I'll also be releasing the precompiler (preqcc).\
> I better get to work...

## v1.36

This release was mentioned on the TeamFortress homepage:

> Last Updated 10/12/96
> ...
> TeamFortress v1.36 will be released soon

-- [http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~cookj/](https://web.archive.org/web/19970121054942/http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~cookj/) (archived)

> - Intro screens for each class\

>

> Bots probably won't be released with v1.4; you'll just have to wait longer.\

This may have been another internal release like v1.24 or a minor release like 1.22.

It does not appear in the changelog in version 1.37.

## v1.37

Released as 5 files:

* `tf1_37_cl.zip`
* `tf1_37_coop.zip`
* `tf1_37_lan.zip `
* `tf1_37_net.zip `
* `tf1_37_src.zip `

This version is mentioned on the TeamFortress news page:

> 12/12/96\
> Lots of work is being done, to make v1.37 run better on the net. We've had to make a few small sacrificies to reduce player lag, but only in the net server version. There's been a lot of small improvements, and we're continuing beta-testing on these servers:
quake2.tassie.net.au will always be running the latest beta version.
quake.netspace.net.au will swap between running CTF and the v1.37 beta.
> We don't really want to release it until it's perfect, but you can beg for it if you want :)
>
> 10/12/96\
> We've fixed the problems with v1.36 now, with big thanks going to Nige. It should be released tomorrow sometime.

And in an update:

> 8/12/96\
> We're going to get a lot done today. TF v1.4 maybe be closer than you think...

This version was also mentioned in the online FAQ:

> Version 1.4-
>
> -Well, I'm really not going to do much with the FAQ. I'll probably go over the grenades section, because of new info on aliases I've gotten from John. Otherwise, I've kinda scrapped the idea of definition charts and stuff. I'm working on my TF map right now, so the next revision will be in a week, or until I get some more questions or news.
